# k-means

A small python script to emulate the example 1 of the k-means clustering algorithm in ARIN.

To run simply type `python k-means.py` for one iteration or `python k-means.py X` for `X` iterations.

This is not meant to be the best or most efficient implementation just somehing I wrote quickly to demonsrate that it works.
